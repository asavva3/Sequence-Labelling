# Sequence-Labelling

In this assignment, we performed sequence labelling by applying conditional random fields. We have created a baseline (inspiring from CRF
scikit-learn tutorial[1]), introduced new features, tuned models via hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) and compared the results along with introducing the most impactful feature combinations.
